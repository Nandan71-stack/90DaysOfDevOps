90 Daysof Devops Learning!!
Every Weekend need to attend live class.
Every day need to open PC and practice which taught by instructor.
Every day wise need to create learning files.

Step1:
Your Understanding of DevOps & Cloud Engineering

DevOps = Culture + Tools + Automation
It connects Development → Testing → Deployment → Monitoring so software ships faster, safer, and repeatedly.
Cloud Engineering = Using AWS/Azure/GCP to build:
Scalable infrastructure
Automated deployments
Secure & highly available systems
